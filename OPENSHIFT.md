### Setting up GitLab

Register for GitLab with https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in#register-pane

After logging in, click the green New Project button on the top left, and select the Import project tab. Click Repo by URL, and paste in this link: <https://api.glitch.com/arras-template/git>, and create the repository.

Go to your Profile settings, and find Access tokens. Choose a name and select the `api` scope, and click the Create personal access token button. Save the access token in a secured place like that text document.

### Creating an OpenShift project

You wait for a box to magically appear and click Open Web Console

On the left, click the Node.js box. Click Next. Pick some uncreative names like Arras, and paste the repo's HTTPS link. Click Create.

After a bit, on the right sidebar, your project should pop up. Open it, ignore the build error (we'll fix that soon) or anything about metrics (don't always happen, not important), and go to Resource > Secrets > Create Secret.

For password or token, put your access token. Don't touch anything else, and just name and create your secret.

Go to Builds > Builds and select your build. On the top right click Action > Edit. Click advanced options in the Source Configuration, and select your newly made secret where it says Source Secret. Scroll to the bottom and save.
